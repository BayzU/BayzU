**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

As a fellow at Marcy Lab School, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that can benefit people's lives. With a background in graphic design and an eagerness to learn software engineering, I strive to combine these two fields to produce exceptional products that can bring positive change to the world.

My experience in graphic design has taught me the value of aesthetics and user experience in design, and my software engineering skills are allowing me to turn those concepts into reality. I am constantly honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends, so that I can create high-quality products that people will love. In addition to my work, I also have a passion for cooking. When I'm not busy with work, you can often find me experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me. Let's create something amazing together!

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
